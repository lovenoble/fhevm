# Using Hardhat

> Our library TFHE requires Solidity version **0.8.19** specifically, as we rely on features exclusive to this version and do not currently provide support for versions beyond it.

The best way to start writing smart contracts with fhEVM is to use our [Hardhat template](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template).

It allows you to start a fhEVM docker image and run your smart contract on it. Read the [README](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
