# Installation

To get started with fhevmjs, you need to install it as a dependency in your JavaScript project. You can do this using npm, Yarn or pnpm. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install fhevmjs

# Using Yarn
yarn add fhevmjs

# Using pnpm
pnpm add fhevmjs
```

This will download and install the fhevmjs library and its dependencies into your project.
